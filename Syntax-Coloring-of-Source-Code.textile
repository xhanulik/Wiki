h1. Syntax Coloring of Source Code

Trac supports language-specific syntax highlighting of source code within wiki formatted text in [WikiProcessors#CodeHighlightingSupport wiki processors] blocks and in the [TracBrowser repository browser].

To do this, Trac uses external libraries with support for a great number of programming languages.

Currently Trac supports syntax coloring using one or more of the following packages:

 * "Pygments":http://pygments.pocoo.org/, by far the preferred system, as it covers a wide range of programming languages and other structured texts and is actively supported
 * "GNU Enscript":http://www.codento.com/people/mtr/genscript/, commonly available on Unix but somewhat unsupported on Windows
 * "SilverCity":http://silvercity.sourceforge.net/, legacy system, some versions can be "problematic":http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracFaq#why-is-my-css-code-not-being-highlighted-even-though-i-have-silvercity-installed


To activate syntax coloring, simply install either one (or more) of these packages (see [#ExtraSoftware] section below).
If none of these packages is available, Trac will display the data as plain text. 


h3. About Pygments

Starting with trac 0.11 "pygments":http://pygments.org/ will be the new default highlighter. It's a highlighting library implemented in pure python, very fast, easy to extend and "well documented":http://pygments.org/docs/.

The Pygments default style can specified in the [TracIni#mimeviewer-section mime-viewer] section of trac.ini. The default style can be overridden by setting a Style preference on the [/prefs/pygments preferences page]. 

It's very likely that the list below is outdated because the list of supported pygments lexers is growing weekly. Just have a look at the page of "supported lexers":http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/ on the pygments webpage.
