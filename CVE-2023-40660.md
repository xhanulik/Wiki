[CVE-2023-40660](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-40660): Potential PIN bypass with empty PIN (#2806, frankmorgner/OpenSCToken#50)
========================================================================================

When the token/card was plugged into the computer and authenticated from one
process, it could be used to provide cryptographic operations from different
process when the empty, zero-length PIN was provided and the token could track
the login status using some of its internals.
This is dangerous for OS logon/screen unlock and small tokens that are plugged
permanently to the computer.
The bypass was removed and OpenSC implemented explicit logout for most of
the card drivers to prevent leaving unattended logged-in tokens.

The PoC is available for MacOS screen unlock bypass with Yubikey.
The issue can be reproduced also with a PKCS#11 module and Minidriver if the
calling applications does not bail out on empty pin (For example with Firefox.
The SSSD does not allow empty PIN under Linux even before reaching out to the
PKCS#11 module).

Note, that the login tracking is still useful on the pkcs15init layer so
the second commit restores the similar code block in more appropriate place
which could not be misused to bypass authentication on PKCS#11 layer.

Affected versions: OpenSC 0.17.0 - 0.23.0

Fixed with:
