The [GoID fingerprint
card](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/attachments/wiki/GoID_EN.PDF) is a
contactless smart card with an integrated fingerprint sensor and PIN pad for
user authentication. The GoID is capable of hosting multiple
on-card-applications. It is compatible with every contactless smart card reader
(or phone) and complies with the ISO/IEC defined IDT form factor.

In the default configuration, the GoID card ships with the following on-card-applications:
- [SmartCard-HSM](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM) as PKI
  application (available via PKCS#11, Minidriver, Tokend, CKT)
- [PAccess](https://www.cryptoplexity.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/media/crypt/publications_1/access_control.pdf)
  for physical access control

The GoID has also been verified to be compatible with the following
- PKI applications:
  - [Cryptovision ePasslet Suite](https://www.cryptovision.com/en/products/epasslet/)
  - [IsoApplet](https://github.com/philipWendland/IsoApplet)
- Classical Physical Access Control Systems:
  - [Mifare DESFire](https://www.mifare.net/en/products/chip-card-ics/mifare-desfire/)
  - [LEGIC advant](https://www.legic.com/technology-platform/smartcard-ics/)

## Changing the PIN

Changing the PIN requires prior authentication of the (initial) PIN.  (With
`goid-tool --info` you can verify the exact configuration of the card).

To change the PIN from its current (initial) value, use the following command:
```
goid-tool --verify-pin --new-pin
```
The program will...
1. Ask for the current (initial) PIN on the builtin PIN-pad
2. Ask for the new PIN on the builtin PIN-pad
3. Ask for verifying new PIN on the builtin PIN-pad

## Changing or Initializing the Fingerprints

The card is capable of holding 16 fingerprint templates for authenticating the
user. This allows initializing a single finger multiple times for extra
robustness, e.g. in different positions. And multiple fingers can be used for
extra convenience in different situations, e.g. the thumb for physical access
while holding the card and the index finger for PKI use while the card is lying
on a reader.

Changing or initializing one or more fingerprint templates requires prior
authentication of the PIN.  (With `goid-tool --info` you can verify the exact
configuration of the card.)

For example, to initialize two fingers in three different positions, i.e. six
finger print templates, use the following command:
```
goid-tool --verify-pin --new-bio --new-bio --new-bio --new-bio --new-bio --new-bio
```
The program will...
1. Ask for the current PIN on the builtin PIN-pad
2. Ask six times for
   1. ... putting a finger on the builtin sensor
   2. ... verifying the finger on the builtin sensor

## Initializing SmartCardHSM

Initializing - and thereby erasing all keys, certificates and data elements - requires the following command

```
sc-hsm-tool --initialize --so-pin 3537363231383830 --user-pin=648219 --bio-server1 D276000172536F434D01
```

Unless stated otherwise, the SmartCard-HSM on the GoID is usually shipped
uninitialized, meaning that no SO-PIN is set. You will first need to perform an
initialization to set the SO-PIN and register the on-card user authentication.
Any later initialization requires the presentation of the same SO-PIN.

The SO-PIN must be composed of 16 hexadecimal characters. The value is
internally converted into an 8 byte key value. The SO-PIN has a retry counter
of 15 and can not be unblocked. Blocking the SO-PIN will prevent any further
token initialization.

Further personalization of the applet is described on the [SmartCardHSM
page](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM). It's features include:
- Support for [RSA and ECC](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM#generate-key-pair)
- Support for [key backup and
  restore](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM#using-key-backup-and-restore)
  optionally using a [n-of-m threshold
  scheme](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM#using-a-n-of-m-threshold-scheme)

For example, generating a RSA key with a self signed certificate could be done as follows:
```sh
export TYPE=rsa:2048
export LABEL=$TYPE
export ID=10
pkcs11-tool --login --keypairgen --key-type="$TYPE" --label="$LABEL" --id=$ID
certtool --generate-self-signed --outfile="$TYPE.cert" --provider="opensc-pkcs11.so" --load-privkey "pkcs11:object=$LABEL;type=private" --load-pubkey "pkcs11:object=$LABEL;type=public"
openssl x509 -inform PEM -outform DER -in "$TYPE.cert" -out "$TYPE.cert.der"
pkcs11-tool --write-object "$TYPE.cert.der" --type=cert --id=$ID --label="$LABEL"
```

## Standard Use in PKCS#11, Minidriver and Tokend

The recommended settings for the GoID card looks like this:
```
app default {
	debug_file = opensc-debug.txt;
	card_drivers = sc-hsm;
	framework pkcs15 {
		try_emulation_first = yes;
		use_file_caching = true;
	}
}
```
The configuration file can be found here:
- *Windows* `C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\opensc.conf`
- *Windows (for 32 bit programs)* `C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\opensc.conf`
- *macOS* `/Library/OpenSC/etc/opensc.conf`

The GoID's device issuer certificate needs to be trusted. You need to copy
[DESCHSMDVCA00001](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/attachments/wiki/DESCHSMDVCA00001) and
[DESRCACC100001](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/attachments/wiki/DESRCACC100001)
to the following locations:
- *Windows* `C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\cvc`
- *Windows (for 32 bit programs)* `C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\cvc`
- *macOS* `/Library/OpenSC/etc/eac/cvc`
